# Golang Text Editor

This is just a side project that I play around with when bored of python.

## Project outline

I wanted to attempt to emulate a command line text editor like vim.

One main goal of this project is to use as little external libraries as possible, hence most of the work will be done using the Go standard library.

I am also attempting to switch to Vim from VSCode whilst writing this project so progress is slow to begin with.

## Usage (PLAN)

1. Clone the repo
2. go build -o textedit .
3. ./textedit **filename**
